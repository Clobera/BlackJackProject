# Blackjack Project


### Description
We were tasked with recreating the game blackjack using java! black jack has two players: the user(person using code in this case) and the dealer. The game starts off by shuffling the deck of cards and dealing two cards each to both players. The two cards delt to user are visible and only one card delt to the dealer is visible. The user is then prompted to choose whether or not to add a card to his hand of cards or to stay. After the player finishes their turn by choosing to stay, the dealer then either adds cards to their hand or stays. the point of the game is to get as close or exactly to 21 with out going over.

### What I learned
<li> I learned the importance of planning out and saying what i want to do before starting to code. many times i found myself just starting out at random places and getting stuck. Saying what i needed to do then figuring out how that translated to logic helped a lot.
<li> I also learned that taking breaks is much needed. We had gotten this on Friday and were told that we were ahead so i wanted to take advantage of the time we got but i found myself stuck and frustrated that i didn't understand. the following day when i began to work on it again i figured it out and got the hard part of my project done with.
